In this project, the model was trained to predict the stock price of JSW Steel using historical data from 31-12-2023 to 31-12-2024. The process involved cleaning and pre-processing the dataset, followed by testing for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. To identify the appropriate lag structure for the Autoregressive and Moving Average components, PACF and ACF plots were utilized. A correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between the target variable (Closing Price) and external predictors (High and Low prices). Finally, separate SARIMAX models were trained for each exogenous variable to predict the Closing Price, integrating seasonal patterns and external influences for improved accuracy.
